# Vision

 - hardware is ever changing, established codebase of mature software projects - is eternal
 - all leading in class proprietary software, all underlying tools will be available to the humans in STC as a buildable in virtual machines code (and code necessary to build those build VMs using only files on disk and latest Ubuntu) on the release day
 - in case of non-cooperation of corporation that's software is needed for the project, decade long ultimatum will be issued. If in 10 years from ultimatum date proprietary software source code/build tools is not given to STC project, OpenSource alternative will be developed
 - open source hardware should have priority for inclusion only if it's a) educational or b) leading in class
 - use leading in class proprietary hardware
   - use manufacturers provided software
     - except for system control software. Use ROS for that
     - except for visualization, use UnrealEngine for that
 - humanoid robot can repeat actions of the person in a workshop, if robot is placed in the same workshop
 - auto clicker robot can repeat actions of person doing boring repetitive actions on the screen
 - voluntary surveillance strictly used to train models for solving the greatest problems of humanity with AI is good
 - flat consumer general computing system, such as Windows, iOS and OS X, have reached their maximum potential of development as of 2022, could be run in its current state in the virtual machines on the hardware that is manufactured by colony
 - hard to manufacture without proper tech tree on a scale needed components, such as microchips, would be prepackaged with information how to produce them at scale
 - wood will be prepackaged for deployment of human habitat/on-site prototype construction in woodless environments
